     * Scenario:
     * an array containing integers
     * and a number to find
     *
     * Constraints:
     * input can be positive, negative
     * numToFind can be positive, negative
     *
     * E.g. [3, 6, 7, 8, 2], find integers that sum up to 10.
     *
     * Here 8 & 2 would sum up to 10
     * What if there were two sets?  Let's just find the first two numbers that sum
     *
     * Approach 1:
     * N^2 brute force: two for loops adding all the permutations
     *
     * Approach 2:
     * Sort smallest to largest first
     * [2, 3, 6, 7, 8]
     *
